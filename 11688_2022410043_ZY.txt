摘要

蛋白质组学是后基因组时代的重要研究领域。作为生命活动的物质基础和细胞功能的直接执行者，蛋白质在生物系统中扮演着不可或缺的角色。系统生物学研究表明，细胞内约83%的蛋白质通过动态相互作用的形式与其他蛋白质形成稳定的功能模块，如信号体、转录复合体等，以共同完成特定的细胞功能。蛋白质复合物是指一组蛋白质在特定条件下通过相互作用聚集形成的稳定结构。根据其生物学重要性，蛋白质可分为关键蛋白质和非关键蛋白质两类，其中关键蛋白质是维持细胞正常生命活动所必需的最小蛋白质组。然而，生物湿实验方法在识别蛋白质复合物和关键蛋白质时，往往耗时费力且成本高昂，难以大规模推广。随着高通量技术的发展，积累了丰富的蛋白质相互作用数据，这也为通过计算方法识别和研究关键蛋白质和蛋白质复合物提供了便利。因此，利用图论方法从蛋白质相互作用网络（Protein-protein Interaction Network, PIN）中识别蛋白质复合物和关键蛋白质成为当前研究的热点。

本文以真实的蛋白质相互作用网络为基础，结合多源生物信息，运用复杂网络理论对蛋白质复合物和关键蛋白质的识别展开深入研究。针对当前广泛使用的三-西格玛法则和二元相互作用网络在捕捉节点高阶拓扑信息方面的局限性，本文分别设计了一种蛋白质复合物识别算法和一种关键蛋白质识别算法。本文的主要工作如下。
    
（1）基于动态网络和基因本体语义相似性，提出了蛋白质复合物识别算法PCEGS。首先，PCEGS首次将关键蛋白质引入动态网络的构建过程，为每个蛋白质设置了全局唯一的表达活性阈值。在一定程度上弥补了三-西格玛方法在构建动态网络的不足，即存在大量蛋白质在整个生命周期内均处于失活状态。其次，结合基因本体论（Gene Ontology, GO）父项术语和子项术语的语义相似性量化蛋白质对之间的功能相似性，并结合拓扑特征为对 PIN 添加权重。最后，在每一个加权的动态子网络中，使用核心-附属结构识别蛋白质复合物，并将内聚力指数作为判定标准，删除识别的冗余复合物以最终形成 PCEGS 算法的识别结果。在三个酿酒酵母PIN数据集上的对比实验表明，PCEGS 的 Acc、F-score、MMR 和 Sn 分别比排名第二的方法高出 2.4%、7.0%、9.1%和4.3%。这证明了改进的动态网络以及GO语义相似性的有效性。

（2） 基于高阶异质网络和混合随机游走，提出关键蛋白质识别算法HWMHON。蛋白质通常是通过相互作用，与多个蛋白质形成复合物共同发挥其细胞功能。针对二元相互作用网络无法描述多元相互作用和捕捉节点的高阶拓扑特征，HWMHON首次将多阶图引入关键蛋白质的识别领域，采用随机游走的策略识别关键蛋白质。首先，HWMHON从PIN和蛋白质复合物中提取高阶结构，并结合蛋白质-GO异质网络形成多阶异质网络。其次，设计了混合随机游走策略，即向上游走和向下游走以及经典随机游走的线性组合。其中向上游走，即从PIN游走至高阶结构并返回PIN中；向下游走即从PIN游走至蛋白质-GO异质网络中并返回PIN。最后，根据混合随机游走收敛时的概率分布，对蛋白质的重要性程度打分。在DIP、Krogan extended 和 Gavin数据集中，HWMHON算法的准确率分别达到85%、75.41%和65.34%。HWMHON在关键蛋白质识别任务中表现出优异的准确性与稳定性，整体性能优于多数现有方法，具有良好的泛化能力与实际应用价值。这说明高阶结构和混合随机游走策略有助于捕捉节点的高阶拓扑特征。

Abstract

Proteomics is a crucial research field in the post-genomic era. As the fundamental basis of life activities and the direct executors of cellular functions, proteins play an indispensable role in biological systems. Studies in systems biology have demonstrated that approximately 83% of proteins within a cell form stable functional modules through dynamic interactions with other proteins, such as signaling complexes and transcription bodies, to collaboratively achieve specific cellular functions. A protein complex is a stable structure formed by a group of proteins that aggregate through interactions under specific conditions. Based on their biological significance, proteins can be categorized into two groups: essential proteins and non-essential proteins. Essential proteins represent the smallest subset necessary to sustain normal cellular life activities. However, traditional experimental methods for identifying protein complexes and essential proteins are often time-consuming and costly, hindering large-scale advancements in this area. With the advent of high-throughput technologies, a wealth of protein interaction data has been accumulated, facilitating the identification and study of essential proteins and protein complexes through computational methods. Consequently, the identification of protein complexes and essential proteins from Protein-Protein Interaction Networks (PINs) using graph-theoretic methods has emerged as a prominent focus in current research.

In this thesis, we utilize real protein interaction networks, combined with multi-source bioinformatics data, to conduct an in-depth study on the identification of protein complexes and essential proteins through the application of complex network theory. To address the limitations of the commonly used 3-sigma rule and binary interaction networks in capturing high-order topological information of nodes, we propose two distinct algorithms: one for recognizing protein complexes and another for identifying essential proteins. The main work of this thesis is as follows.

(1) A protein complex recognition algorithm, named PCEGS, is proposed. It is based on dynamic networks and gene ontology semantic similarity weighting. Specifically, PCEGS introduces essential proteins into the construction process of the dynamic network for the first time and establishes a globally unique expression activity threshold for each protein. This approach addresses the limitations of the 3-sigma method in constructing dynamic networks, particularly the presence of numerous proteins that remain inactive throughout their life cycle. Additionally, the semantic similarity between parent and child terms of Gene Ontology (GO) is utilized to quantify the functional similarity between protein pairs, while topological features are incorporated to assign weights to pairs of PINs. Finally, within each weighted dynamic sub-network, protein complexes are identified using the core-subsidiary structure, and the cohesion index is calculated. The identified redundant complexes are removed using a decision criterion to finalize the identification results of the PCEGS algorithm. Comparative experiments on three yeast PIN datasets demonstrate that PCEGS outperforms the second-best method by 2.4%, 7.0%, 9.1%, and 4.3% in terms of Acc, F-score, MMR, and Sn, respectively. These results underscore the effectiveness of the improved dynamic network and the incorporation of GO semantic similarity.

(2) A essential protein identification algorithm, named HWMHON, is proposed. This algorithm is based on higher-order heterogeneous networks and hybrid stochastic wandering. Proteins typically perform their cellular functions by interacting with multiple partners to form complexes; however, binary interaction networks often fail to capture the multivariate interactions and higher-order topological features inherent in such systems. To address this limitation, HWMHON introduces the concept of a multi-order graph into the field of essential protein identification for the first time and employs a random walk strategy to identify essential proteins. Specifically, HWMHON extracts higher-order structures from PINs and protein complexes, then integrates these with protein-GO heterogeneous networks to construct a multi-order heterogeneous network. Furthermore, a hybrid stochastic random walk strategy is developed, which linearly combines upward random walks, downward random walks, and classical random walks. In this context, upward random walks refer to transitions from the PIN to higher-order structures and back, while downward random walks denote transitions from the PIN to the protein-GO heterogeneous network and back to the PIN. Finally, the significance of each protein is quantified based on the probability distribution obtained upon convergence of the hybrid random walk, and the top K proteins are selected as the essential protein set. On the DIP, Krogan, and Gavin datasets, the accuracy of the HWMHON algorithm reached 85%, 75.41%, and 65.34%, respectively. These results demonstrate that HWMHON exhibits excellent accuracy and stability in essential protein identification tasks, consistently outperforming most existing methods. Its robust generalization ability and practical application value indicate that leveraging high-order structures and a hybrid random walk strategy effectively captures the high-order topological features of nodes.
